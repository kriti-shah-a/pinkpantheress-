# PinkPantheress TikTok Trend

A fun little web project inspired by the TikTok trend set to *"Illegal"* by PinkPantheress, where people mimic *picking up and dragging someone* in sync with the lyric:  
> "*My name is Pink and I'm really glad to meet you
You're recommended to me by some people
Hey, ooh, is this illegal?
Hey, ooh, it feels illegal*"

### What is it?

This project replicates that playful vibe using an interactive draggable image. When you click and drag, the image changes to simulate the same vibe as the TikTok trend where users drag their friends off-screen.

### Features

- Click and drag functionality using vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamic image swapping between "hand down" and "hand up" for visual effect
- CSS styling for smooth visuals
- Includes a video background

### ðŸš€ How to Use

Just open `index.html` in your browser â€” then click and drag the hand!
