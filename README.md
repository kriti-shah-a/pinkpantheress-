# PinkPantheress TikTok Trend

A fun little web project inspired by the TikTok trend set to *"Illegal"* by PinkPantheress, where people mimic *picking up and dragging someone* in sync with the lyric:  
> "*My name is Pink and I'm really glad to meet you
You're recommended to me by some people
Hey, ooh, is this illegal?
Hey, ooh, it feels illegal*"

### ðŸŽ¯ What is it?

This project replicates that playful vibe using an interactive draggable image. When you click and drag, the hand image changes to simulate "grabbing" â€” just like in the TikTok videos where users drag their friends off-screen.

### ðŸ’¡ Features

- Click and drag functionality using vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamic image swapping between "hand down" and "hand up" for visual effect
- CSS styling for smooth visuals
- Including a video background
